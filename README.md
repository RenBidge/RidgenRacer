Welcome to RidgenRacer, a small car game where your objective is to avoid the obstacles.

Run `Python RaceCarGame.py` from the Pygame directory to play the game.

I have not yet made this executable so please download pygame and python before executing the python code.

In game, press 'p' to pause if you need to cool off.
